In 1954, Neill returned with his family to New Zealand, where he attended the [[Anglican]] boys' boarding school [[Christ's College, Canterbury|Christ's College]] in Christchurch. He then went on to study English literature at the [[University of Canterbury]] where he had his first exposure to acting. While at university he lived at [[College House (University of Canterbury)|College House]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=341&ObjectID=10353801 |title=Study costs rising by degrees | work=Tertiary education news |publisher=NZ Herald |date=6 November 2005 |accessdate=22 July 2010|author=Sarah Catherall}}</ref> where he held the position of "Chief Castigator and Crime Crusher" (CCACC). He then moved to Wellington to continue his tertiary education at [[Victoria University of Wellington|Victoria University]] from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature.

In 2004, on Australian talk show ''[[Enough Rope]]'', interviewer [[Andrew Denton]] briefly touched on the issue of Neill's "very bad" stuttering. It affected most of his childhood and as a result he was "hoping that people wouldn't talk to [him]" so he would not have to answer back. He has mostly outgrown it, however he claims it can still be detected to this day.<ref name="abc.net.au">{{cite episode|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s1126851.htm | series = Enough Rope with Andrew Denton |episode = 45 | title = Sam Neill | network = ABC |location = Australia |date=7 June 2004 | accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>

==Acting career==
[[File:Sam Neill cropped.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Sam Neill at the première of ''[[Daybreakers]]'' during the Toronto International Film Festival, 2009]]
After working at the New Zealand National Film Unit as a director and actor Neill was cast as the lead in the New Zealand film ''[[Sleeping Dogs (1977 film)|Sleeping Dogs]]''. Following this he appeared in the Australian classic, ''[[My Brilliant Career (film)|My Brilliant Career]]'' (1979), opposite [[Judy Davis]].  In the late 1970s, his mentor was [[James Mason]].

This appearance led to his being selected to play [[Damien Thorn]] in ''[[Omen III: The Final Conflict]]'' in 1981.  Later, Neill was also one of the leading candidates to succeed [[Roger Moore]] in the role of [[James Bond]], but he lost out to [[Timothy Dalton]].

An important dramatic role was in ''[[Evil Angels]]'' (1988), released outside of Australia as ''A Cry In The Dark'', about the case of [[Azaria Chamberlain]].

Neill has played heroes and villains in a succession of film and television dramas and comedies. In the UK he became well-known in the early 1980s starring in dramas such as ''[[Ivanhoe (1982 film)|Ivanhoe]]'' (1982) and notably in the title role of ''[[Reilly, Ace of Spies]]'' (1983). Neill is known for his leading and co-starring roles in major films including ''[[Dead Calm (film)|Dead Calm]]'' (1989), ''[[La Révolution française (film)|La Révolution française]]'' (1989) playing the famous [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]], ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'' (1990), ''[[Memoirs of an Invisible Man]]'' (1992), ''[[The Piano]]'' (1993), ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993), ''[[Sirens (film)|Sirens]]'' (1994), ''[[Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book]]'' (1994), ''[[In the Mouth of Madness]]'' (1995), ''[[Event Horizon (film)|Event Horizon]]'' (1997), ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]] (1999), [[The Dish]]'' (2000) and ''[[Jurassic Park III]]'' (2001).

The film ''[[Cinema of Unease|Cinema of Unease: A Personal Journey by Sam Neill]]'' (1995) was written and directed by Sam Neill and [[Judy Rymer]]. In it Neill narrated his personal recollection of New Zealand film history.

In 1993, Neill co-starred with [[Anne Archer]] in ''Question of Faith'', an independent drama based on a true story about one woman's fight to beat cancer and have a baby.

In 2002 he hosted and narrated a series of documentaries for the BBC entitled ''[[Space (documentary)|Space]]'' (''Hyperspace'' in the United States).

In 2006, Neill recorded a series of radio advertisements for [[Fifth Third Bank]] in the midwestern United States.

Neill also appeared in ''[[Merlin (film)|Merlin]]'' (1998), a miniseries based on the legends of [[King Arthur]], portraying the legendary wizard. He also reprised his role as Merlin in the sequel, ''[[Merlin's Apprentice]]'' (2006), in which Merlin learns he fathered a son with the Lady of the Lake.

Neill starred in the historical drama ''The Tudors'' on the [[Showtime Network]] playing [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Thomas Wolsey]]. "I have to say I really enjoyed making ''The Tudors''", Neill said,<ref name=PCOLThewest/> “It was six months with a character that I found immensely intriguing, with a cast that I liked very much and with a story I found very compelling. It has elements that are hard to beat: revenge and betrayal, lust and treason, all the things that make for good stories."<ref name=PCOLThewest/> Neill starred as Mr. Jones in ''[[Under the Mountain (film)|Under the Mountain]]'' and as Charles Bromley in ''[[Daybreakers]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35185/latest-daybreakers-clip-features-sam-neill |title=Latest Daybreakers Clip Features Sam Neill |publisher=Dread Central  |date=8 January 2010 |accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>

He also starred in an ABC TV production called ''[[Happy Town (TV series)|Happy Town]]'' (2010), in which he played Merritt Grieves, a mysterious film memorabilia shop proprietor. He has also been cast in the Fox TV series ''[[Alcatraz (TV series)|Alcatraz]]'' as Emerson Hauser.

==Personal life==
Neill lives in Queenstown, New Zealand and also has homes in Wellington, New Zealand and Sydney, Australia. He has one son, Tim (born in 1983), by New Zealand actress [[Lisa Harrow]], and one daughter, Elena (born in 1991),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.movies.yahoo.com/actor-crew/121889/sam-neill/friends-family/ |title=Sam Neill&nbsp;— Family & Companions – |publisher=Yahoo!7 Movies |date=10 January 1991 |accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref> by makeup artist Noriko Watanabe, whom he married in 1989.

Neill's hobby is running a  [[winery]] called [[Two Paddocks]] in [[Central Otago]] on New Zealand's South Island.<ref name=PCOLThewest/> "I’d like the vineyard to support me but I’m afraid it is the other way round. It is not a very economic business", said Neill,<ref name=PCOLThewest/> "It is a ridiculously time and money-consuming business. I would not do it if it was not so satisfying and fun: and it gets me pissed once in a while."<ref name=PCOLThewest>[http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=24&ContentID=57032 The West.  "A glorious romp through history" by Pam Brown. 5 February 2008.]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref> 

Neill is friends with New Zealand musicians [[Neil Finn]] and [[Tim Finn]], of [[Crowded House]] and [[Split Enz]], and with Australian musician [[Jimmy Barnes]].{{fact|date=January 2012}}

Neill has been appointed a Distinguished Companion of the [[New Zealand Order of Merit]] (DCNZM). When knighthoods were returned to the [[New Zealand Honours System]] in 2009, those with DCNZM or higher honours were given the option of converting them into knighthoods. Neill chose not to do this, saying the title of Sir was "just far too grand, by far".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/the-regions/otago/67857/sir-039just-far-too-grand039-neill|title=Sir 'just far too grand' for Neill|date=1 Aug 2009|publisher=Otago Daily Times|accessdate=1 August 2009}}</ref>
