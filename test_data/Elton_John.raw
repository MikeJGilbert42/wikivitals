=== Early life ===
John was born Reginald Kenneth Dwight on 25 March 1947, the eldest child of Stanley and only child of Sheila Eileen Dwight (née Harris)<ref>[http://www.parade.com/celebrity/2010/02/elton-john.html "'I Have So Much More To Do'"].

When John began to seriously consider a career in music, his father, who served as a [[Flight Lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Air Force]], tried to steer him toward a more conventional career, such as banking.<ref name="Norman"/> John has stated that his wild stage costumes and performances were his way of letting go after such a restrictive childhood.<ref name="VisualDoc" /> Both of John's parents were musically inclined, his father having been a trumpet player with the Bob Millar Band, a semi-professional big band that played at military dances.<ref name="VisualDoc"/>  The Dwights were keen record buyers, exposing John to the popular singers and musicians of the day, and John remembers being immediately hooked on rock and roll when his mother brought home records by [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Bill Haley & His Comets]] in 1956.<ref name="Norman"/><ref name="Rosenthal"/>

John started playing the piano at the age of 3, and within a year, his mother heard him picking out [[Winifred Atwell]]'s "The Skater's Waltz" by ear.<ref name="Norman"/><ref name="Rosenthal"/>  After performing at parties and family gatherings, at the age of 7 he took up formal piano lessons. He showed musical aptitude at school, including the ability to compose melodies, and gained some notoriety by playing like [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] at school functions.  At the age of 11, he won a junior scholarship to the [[Royal Academy of Music]]. According to one of his instructors, John promptly played back, like a "gramophone record", a four-page piece by [[Handel]] that he heard for the first time.<ref name="Rosenthal"/>

For the next five years he attended Saturday classes at the Academy in central London, and has stated that he enjoyed playing [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and singing in the choir during Saturday classes, but that he was not otherwise a diligent classical student.<ref name="Rosenthal"/>  "I kind of resented going to the Academy", he says.  "I was one of those children who could just about get away without practising and still pass, scrape through the grades."<ref name="Rosenthal"/>  He even claims that he would sometimes skip classes and just ride around on [[London Underground|the Tube]].<ref name="Rosenthal"/> However, several instructors have testified that he was a "model student", and during the last few years he was taking lessons from a private tutor in addition to his classes at the Academy.<ref name="Rosenthal"/>

John's mother, though also strict with her son, was more vivacious than her husband, and something of a free spirit.  With Stanley Dwight uninterested in his son and often physically absent, John was raised primarily by his mother and maternal grandmother.  When his father was home, the Dwights would have terrible arguments that greatly distressed their son.<ref name="Rosenthal"/>  When John was 14, they divorced.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1280288/Sir-Elton-John-From-football-clubs-drug-addiction-Princess-Dianas-funeral.html Sir Elton John: From football clubs and drug addiction to Princess Diana's funeral] Daily Mail.

It was there that John would write the songs that would launch his career as a rock star; he would live there until he had four albums simultaneously in the American Top 40.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onthisveryspot.com/spot/EJ_Frome_Court |title=Frome Court – On This Very Spot |publisher=On This Very Spot |date=3 April 2007 |accessdate=25 February 2009}}</ref>

In 1964, Dwight and his friends formed a band called [[Bluesology]]. By day, he ran errands for a music publishing company; he divided his nights between solo gigs at a London hotel bar and working with Bluesology. By the mid-1960s, Bluesology was backing touring American [[soul music|soul]] and [[R&B]] musicians like [[The Isley Brothers]], [[Major Lance]], [[Billy Stewart]], [[Doris Troy]] and [[Labelle|Patti LaBelle and The Bluebelles]]. In 1966, the band became musician [[Long John Baldry]]'s supporting band and played 16 times at [[The Marquee Club]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themarqueeclub.net/long-john-baldry |title=The Marquee Club: Long John Baldry – Biography |publisher=themarqueeclub.net |accessdate=25 May 2010 }}</ref>

The team of John and Taupin joined [[Dick James]]'s [[DJM Records]] as staff songwriters in 1968, and over the next two years wrote material for various artists, like [[Roger Cook (songwriter)|Roger Cook]] and [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]].<ref name="Vinita">{{Cite book |title=Profiles in Popular Music |last=Vinita |publisher=Sura Books |year=2005 |page=79 |isbn=978-81-7478-638-8}}</ref> Taupin would write a batch of lyrics in under an hour and give it to John, who would write music for them in half an hour, disposing of the lyrics if he couldn't come up with anything quickly.<ref name="Vinita"/> For two years, they wrote [[easy listening|easy-listening]] tunes for James to peddle to singers. Their early output included a contender for the British entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in 1969, for Lulu, called "Can't Go On (Living Without You)". It came [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1969|sixth]] of six songs. In 1969, John provided piano for [[Roger Hodgson]] on his first released recording, the single "Mr. Boyd" by Argosy, a quartet that was completed by [[Caleb Quaye]] and [[Nigel Olsson]].<ref>Joynson, Vernon (1995).

During this period, John was also a session musician for other artists including playing piano on [[The Hollies]]' "[[He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother]]" and singing backing vocals for [[The Scaffold]].<ref>In his 1981 book "Thank U Very Much – Mike McCartney's Family Album" Scaffold singer Mike McGear (McCartney) describes a meeting with John during which John advises him he used to sing background vocals for the group.</ref>

=== Debut album to ''Goodbye Yellow Brick Road'' (1969–1973) ===

On the advice of music publisher Steve Brown, John and Taupin started writing more complex songs for John to record for DJM. The first was the single "I've Been Loving You" (1968), produced by [[Caleb Quaye]], former Bluesology guitarist. In 1969, with Quaye, drummer Roger Pope, and bassist Tony Murray, John recorded another single, "[[Lady Samantha]]", and an album, ''[[Empty Sky (album)|Empty Sky]]''.

For their follow-up album, ''[[Elton John (album)|Elton John]]'', John and Taupin enlisted [[Gus Dudgeon]] as producer and [[Paul Buckmaster]] as [[Arrangement|musical arranger]]. ''Elton John'' was released in April 1970 on DJM Records/[[Pye Records]] in the UK and [[Uni Records]] in the USA, and established the formula for subsequent albums; gospel-chorded rockers and poignant ballads. The first single from the album, "[[Border Song]]", made into the [[Billboard Hot 100|US Top 100]], peaking at Number 92. The second single "[[Your Song]]" made the US Top Ten, peaking at number eight and becoming John's first hit single as a singer.  The album soon became his first hit album, reaching number four on the [[Billboard 200]] album chart.<ref>Claude Bernardin, Tom Stanton (1996) [http://books.google.com/books?id=eJGcZSyBflwC&pg=PA116&dq=Elton+John+(album)+%234+1970&hl=en&ei=_r7JTMHdI9KH5AaAu8DMAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Elton%20John%20(album)%20%234%201970&f=false Rocket man: Elton John from A-Z] Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996</ref>

The concept album ''[[Tumbleweed Connection]]'' was released in October 1970, and reached the Top Ten on the [[Billboard 200]]. The live album ''[[17-11-70]]'' (''11–17–70'' in the US) was recorded at a live show aired from A&R Studios on [[WABC-FM]] in New York City. Sales of the live album were heavily hit in the US when an east coast [[bootleg recording|bootleg]]ger released the performance several weeks before the official album, including all 60 minutes of the aircast, not just the 40 minutes selected by Dick James Music.<ref>{{cite book|last=Heylin|first=Clinton|title=Bootleg: The Secret History of the Other Recording Industry|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|year=1996|location=New York|isbn=0-312-14289-7|page=66}}</ref>
[[File:Elton John 1972 1603720019.jpg|thumb|Elton John at the [[Laeiszhalle|Musikhalle]], Hamburg in March 1972]]
John and Taupin then wrote the soundtrack to the obscure film ''[[Friends (1971 film)|Friends]]'' and then the album ''[[Madman Across the Water]]'', the latter reaching the Top Ten and producing the hit "[[Levon]]", while the soundtrack album produced the hit "Friends". In 1972, [[Davey Johnstone]] joined the '''Elton John Band''' on guitar and backing vocals. The band released ''[[Honky Chateau]]'', which became John's first American number&nbsp;1 album, spending five weeks at the top of the charts and spawning the hit singles "[[Rocket Man (song)|Rocket Man (I Think It's Going To Be A Long, Long Time)]]" (which is often compared to [[David Bowie]]'s "[[Space Oddity (song)|Space Oddity]]") and "[[Honky Cat]]".<ref>Stephen Thomas Erlewine [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1040357|pure_url=yes}} Honky Chateau (Bonus Track) – Elton John] ''[[All Music]]''</ref>

The pop album ''[[Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player]]'' came out at the start of 1973, and produced the hits "[[Crocodile Rock]]" and "[[Daniel (song)|Daniel]]"; the former became his first US [[Billboard Hot 100]] number&nbsp;one hit.<ref>{{cite book |title= Rock N' Roll Gold Rush |last= Dean |first= Maury |authorlink= Maury Dean |year= 2003 |publisher= Algora |isbn= 0-87586-207-1 |url= |page= 46 }}</ref> Both the album and "[[Crocodile Rock]]" were the first album and single, respectively on the consolidated [[MCA Records]] label in the USA, replacing MCA's other labels including Uni.

''[[Goodbye Yellow Brick Road]]'' gained instant critical acclaim and topped the chart on both sides of the Atlantic, remaining at Number 1 for two months.<ref name="Redbeard GYBR interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.inthestudio.net/|title=Elton John –Goodbye Yellow Brick Road|last=Redbeard|year=2009|work=In the Studio With Redbeard, Interviews With Famous Musicians|publisher=Barbarosa Ltd.

It contained the number&nbsp;1 hit "[[Bennie and the Jets]]", along with the popular and praised "[[Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (song)|Goodbye Yellow Brick Road]]", "[[Candle in the Wind]]", "[[Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting]]", "[[Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding]]" and "[[Grey Seal (song)|Grey Seal]]" (originally recorded and released in 1970 as the B-side to the UK-only single "Rock and Roll Madonna").

=== Rocket Records to ''21 at 33'' (1974–1979) ===
[[File:Elton John nel 1975.jpg|thumb|left|Elton John performing live in 1975]]
John formed his own MCA-distributed label [[Rocket Records]] and signed acts to it – notably [[Neil Sedaka]] ("Bad Blood", on which he sang background vocals) and [[Kiki Dee]] – in which he took a personal interest. Instead of releasing his own records on Rocket, he opted for $8&nbsp;million offered by MCA. When the contract was signed in 1974, MCA reportedly took out a $25&nbsp;million insurance policy on John's life.<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/elton-john/news/artists/8828/56076/56108 Elton John | Rolling Stone Music]{{dead link|date=May 2011}} 2001 encyclopedia.

In 1974 a collaboration with [[John Lennon]] took place, resulting in Lennon appearing on Elton John's single cover of The Beatles' "[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]", the b-side of which was Lennon's "One Day at a Time," and in return Elton John being featured on "[[Whatever Gets You thru the Night]]" on Lennon's "Walls and Bridges" album. Later that year, on Thanksgiving Day, in what would be Lennon's last live performance, the pair performed these two number&nbsp;1 hits along with the Beatles classic "[[I Saw Her Standing There]]" at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York. Lennon made the rare stage appearance with Elton and his band to keep the promise he made that he would appear on stage with Elton if "Whatever Gets You Thru The Night" became a number&nbsp;1 single.<ref>Jeff Woolf, Scott Jennings and James L.

[[Pete Townshend]] of [[The Who]] asked John to play a character called the "Local Lad" in the film of the rock opera ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]'', and to perform the song "[[Pinball Wizard]]". Drawing on [[power chord]]s, John's version was recorded and used for the movie release in 1975 and the single came out in 1976 (1975 in the US). The song charted at number&nbsp;7 in England. [[Bally Technologies|Bally]] subsequently released a "Captain Fantastic" pinball machine featuring an illustration of John in his movie guise.

In the 1975 autobiographical album ''[[Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy]]'', John revealed his previously ambiguous personality, with Taupin's lyrics describing their early days as struggling songwriters and musicians in London. The lyrics and accompanying photo booklet are infused with a specific sense of place and time that is otherwise rare in John's music. "[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]" was the hit single from this album and captured an early turning point in John's life.

The album's release signalled the end of the Elton John Band, as an unhappy and overworked John dismissed Olsson and Murray, two people who had contributed much of the band's signature sound and who had helped build his live following since the beginning.

According to [[Circus Magazine]]<ref name=raves</ref> [[Circus Magazine]], No 115, August 1975. Vol 2, No 8. K48002 pp14–15</ref> a spokesman for John Reid said the decision was reached mutually via phone while Elton was in Australia promoting ''Tommy''.  She said there was no way John Reid could have fired them "because the band are not employed by John Reid, they're employed by Elton John."<ref name=raves</ref></ref>  She went on to say Nigel would be going back to his solo work and Dee would do session work "and possibly cut a solo album".<ref name=raves</ref></ref>

Davey Johnstone and Ray Cooper were retained, Quaye and Roger Pope returned, and the new bassist was Kenny Passarelli; this rhythm section provided a heavier-sounding backbeat. James Newton-Howard joined to arrange in the studio and to play keyboards. John introduced the line-up before a crowd of 75,000 in London's [[Wembley Stadium]].

The rock-oriented ''[[Rock of the Westies]]'' entered the US albums chart at number&nbsp;1 like ''Captain Fantastic'', a previously unattained feat. Elton John's stage wardrobe now included [[ostrich]] feathers, $5,000 spectacles that spelled his name in lights, and dressing up like the [[Statue of Liberty]], [[Donald Duck]], or [[Mozart]], among others, at his concerts.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=5K61qKj1Oj0C&pg=PA192&dq=elton+john+dressed+as+mozart&hl=en&ei=PMXJTKeuOJaSjAf0lsXiDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=elton%20john%20dressed%20as%20mozart&f=false 100 years 100 songs] ''Music Sales Corporation'' Omnibus Press, 1999</ref><ref>Nigel Goodall (1993) ''Elton John: a visual documentary'' Omnibus Press, 1993</ref>

To celebrate five years since he first appeared at the venue, in 1975 John played a two-night, four-show stand at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]]. With seating limited to under 500 per show, the chance to purchase tickets was determined by a postcard lottery, with each winner allowed two tickets. Everyone who attended the performances received a hardbound "yearbook" of the band's history. That year he also played piano on [[Kevin Ayers]]' ''[[Sweet Deceiver]]'', and was among the first and few white artists to appear on the black music series ''[[Soul Train]]'' on American television.<ref name="Redbeard GYBR interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/61905/top_ten_songs_by_elton_john.html?cat=33|title=Ten Songs by Elton John|last=Davis|first=Lisa|date=22 September 2006|publisher=Associated Content |accessdate=19 July 2010}}</ref> On 9 August 1975, John was named the outstanding rock personality of the year at the first annual Rock Music Awards at ceremonies held in Santa Monica, California.<ref>United Press International, "Elton John Named Rock Personality", ''Playground Daily News'', Fort Walton Beach, Florida, Monday 11 August 1975, Volume 30, Number 159, page 14.</ref>

In 1976, the live album ''[[Here and There (Elton John album)|Here and There]]'' was released in May, followed by the ''[[Blue Moves]]'' album in October, which contained the single "[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]]". His biggest success in 1976 was "[[Don't Go Breaking My Heart]]", a duet with Kiki Dee that topped both the American and British charts. Finally, in an interview with ''Rolling Stone'' that year entitled "Elton's Frank Talk", John stated that he was [[bisexual]].<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=dDrVKxE08CUC&q=%22Elton%27s+Frank+Talk%22&dq=%22Elton%27s+Frank+Talk%22 |title=Elton John |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=25 May 2010 |isbn=978-1-56711-972-5 |date=1 December 2003 }}</ref>

[[File:Elton John in 1979 in Mannheim.jpg|thumb|150px|right|John playing in [[Mannheim]], Germany in 1979.]]
Besides being the most commercially successful period, 1970–1976 is also held in the most regard critically. Within only a three year span, between 1972 and 1975 John saw seven consecutive albums reach number one in the US, which had not been accomplished before.<ref name="Redbeard GYBR interview"/> Of the six Elton John albums to make ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s list of "[[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]" in 2003, all are from this period, with ''Goodbye Yellow Brick Road'' ranked highest at number&nbsp;91; similarly, the three Elton John albums given five stars by Allmusic (''Tumbleweed Connection'', ''Honky Château'', and ''Captain Fantastic'') are all from this period.

During the same period, John made a guest appearance on the popular ''[[The Morecambe & Wise Show (1968–1977)|Morecambe and Wise Show]]'' on the BBC. The two comics spent the episode pointing him in the direction of everywhere except the stage in order to prevent him singing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0894463/ |title="The Morecambe & Wise Show" 1977 Christmas Show (1977) |publisher=imdb.com |accessdate=25 May 2010 }}</ref>

In November 1977 John announced he was retiring from performing; Taupin began collaborating with others. Now only producing one album a year, John issued ''[[A Single Man (album)|A Single Man]]'' in 1978, employing a new lyricist, [[Gary Osborne]]; the album produced no singles that made the Top 20 in the US but the two singles from the album released in the UK, [[Part-Time Love]] and [[Song for Guy]], both made the Top 20 in the UK with the latter reaching the Top 5. In 1979, accompanied by [[Ray Cooper]], John became one of the first Western solo artists to tour the Soviet Union (as well as one of the first in [[Israel]]), then mounted a two-man comeback tour of the US in small halls. John returned to the singles chart with "Mama Can't Buy You Love" (number&nbsp;9, 1979), a song originally rejected in 1977 by MCA before being released, recorded in 1977 with Philadelphia soul producer [[Thom Bell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.souljonespresents.com/heroes_thom.html |title=Heroes & Villains – Exclusive Interview with Thom Bell on Soul Jones Presents |publisher=Souljonespresents.com |accessdate=25 February 2009}}</ref>  Elton reported that Thom Bell was the first person to give him voice lessons; Bell encouraged John to sing in a lower register. A [[disco music|disco]]-influenced album, ''[[Victim of Love (album)|Victim of Love]]'', was poorly received. In 1979, John and [[Bernie Taupin|Taupin]] reunited, though they did not collaborate on a full album until 1983's ''[[Too Low For Zero]]''. ''[[21 at 33]]'', released the following year, was a significant career boost, aided by his biggest hit in four years, "[[Little Jeannie]]" (number&nbsp;3 US), although the lyrics were written by [[Gary Osborne]].

=== The 80s: ''The Fox'' to ''Sleeping with the Past'' (1981–1989) ===
[[File:Elton John in 1980s.jpg|thumb|left|Elton performing in the 1980s.]]
His 1981 album, ''[[The Fox (Elton John album)|The Fox]]'', was recorded in part during the same sessions as ''[[21 at 33]]'', and also included collaborations with [[Tom Robinson]] and [[Judie Tzuke]]. On 13 September 1980, John, with Olsson and Murray back in the Elton John Band, performed a free concert to an estimated 400,000 fans on The Great Lawn in [[Central Park]] in New York City. His 1982 hit "[[Empty Garden (Hey Hey Johnny)]]", came from his ''[[Jump Up!]]'' album, his second under a new US recording contract with [[Geffen Records]].

He married his close friend and sound engineer, [[Renate Blauel]] on Valentine's Day 1984 – the marriage lasted three years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1280288/Sir-Elton-John-From-football-clubs-drug-addiction-Princess-Dianas-funeral.html?ito=feeds-newsxml |title=Sir Elton John: From football clubs and drug addiction to Princess Diana's funeral |work=Daily Mail |location=London |accessdate=26 May 2010  | date=21 May 2010}}</ref> The Biography Channel Special detailed the loss of Elton's voice in 1986 while on tour in Australia. Shortly thereafter he underwent throat surgery, which permanently altered his voice. Several non-cancerous polyps were removed from his vocal cords, resulting in a change in his singing voice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://strictlyrock.com/index.php/band/17 |title=StrictlyRock.com – Elton John |publisher=strictlyrock.com |accessdate=26 May 2010 }}</ref> In 1987 he won a libel case against ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' which published allegations of sex with [[rent boys]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/feb/16/sundaytimes.pressandpublishing |title=Elton settles Times libel case |work=The Guardian |location=London  |accessdate=26 May 2010 | date=16 February 2006 | first=Claire | last=Cozens}}</ref>

With original band members Johnstone, Murray and Olsson together again, John was able to return to the charts with the 1983 hit album ''[[Too Low for Zero]]'', which included "[[I'm Still Standing]]" and "[[I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues]]", the latter of which featured [[Stevie Wonder]] on harmonica and reached number&nbsp;4 in the US, giving John his biggest hit there since "Little Jeannie".  He placed hits in the US Top Ten throughout the 1980s – "Little Jeannie" (number&nbsp;3, 1980), "[[Sad Songs (Say So Much)]]" (number&nbsp;5, 1984), "[[Nikita (song)|Nikita]]" boosted by a mini-movie pop video directed by Ken Russell (number&nbsp;7, 1986), a live orchestral version of "Candle in the Wind" (number&nbsp;6, 1987), and "I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That" (number&nbsp;2, 1988). His highest-charting single was a collaboration with [[Dionne Warwick]], [[Gladys Knight]], and Stevie Wonder on "[[That's What Friends Are For]]" (number&nbsp;1, 1985); credited as Dionne and Friends, the song raised funds for AIDS research. His albums continued to sell, but of the six released in the latter half of the 1980s, only ''[[Reg Strikes Back]]'' (number&nbsp;16, 1988) placed in the Top 20 in the United States.

In 1985, Elton John was one of the many performers at [[Live Aid]] held at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].<ref name=CLD/> John played "Bennie and the Jets" and "Rocket Man"; then "Don't Go Breaking My Heart" with Kiki Dee for the first time in years; and introduced his friend [[George Michael]], still then of [[Wham!]], to sing "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me".<ref name=CLD>Claude Bernardin, Tom Stanton [http://books.google.com/books?id=eJGcZSyBflwC&pg=PA57&dq=elton+john+live+aid+1985&hl=en&ei=27cZTbmhDZG4hAe295m3Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=elton%20john%20live%20aid%201985&f=false Rocket man: Elton John from A-Z] P.57.

John also recorded material with [[Millie Jackson]] in 1985. In 1986, he played the piano on two tracks on the [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Saxon (band)|Saxon's]] album ''[[Rock the Nations]]''.

In 1988, he performed five sold-out shows at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]],<ref>Luca Prono [http://books.google.com/books?id=Y3FYzMPH2OwC&pg=PA150&dq=elton+john+1988+sold+out+madison+square+garden&hl=en&ei=0c3JTLHFMY2OjAfx97TeDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=elton%20john%201988%20sold%20out%20madison%20square%20garden&f=false Encyclopedia of gay and lesbian popular culture] Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008</ref> giving him 26 for his career.

=== The 90s: "Sacrifice" to ''Aida'' (1990–1999) ===
In 1990, John finally achieved his first UK number&nbsp;one hit on his own, with "[[Sacrifice (Elton John song)|Sacrifice]]" (coupled with "[[Healing Hands (song)|Healing Hands]]") from the previous year's album ''[[Sleeping with the Past]]''; it would stay at the top spot for six weeks.<ref>{{cite web |title="Sacrifice" (1990 release), UK Singles Chart |url=http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=17695 |publisher=chartstats |accessdate=28 December 2010}}</ref> The following year, John's "Basque" won the [[Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition|Grammy for Best Instrumental]], and a guest concert appearance he had made on [[George Michael]]'s cover of "[[Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me]]" was released as a single and topped the charts in both the US and UK.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1wkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA5&dq=dont+let+the+sun+go+down+on+me+%231+1991&hl=en&ei=hcfJTMe1NIiUOvLf9OIB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false Elton John – 30 Years of Music] ''Billboard'' 4 October 1997</ref> At the [[List of BRIT Awards ceremonies#1991|1991]] [[Brit Awards]] in London, Elton John won the award for Best British Male.<ref>[http://www.brits.co.uk/britstv/1991-best-british-male-elton-john 1991 Brit Awards: Best British Male – Elton John] Brits.co.uk.

===Other===
Throughout his career, John has battled addictions to alcohol and cocaine. By 1975, the pressures of stardom had begun to take a serious toll on him. During "Elton Week" in Los Angeles that year, John suffered a drug overdose.<ref>"Elton John", Biography Channel, 2005</ref>  He also battled the eating disorder [[bulimia]]. In a CNN interview with [[Larry King]] in 2002, King asked if John knew of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]' eating disorder. John replied, "Yes, I did. We were both bulimic."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0201/25/lkl.00.html |title= Larry King Live: Interview With Elton John Aired 25&nbsp;January 2002 |publisher=Transcripts.cnn.com |date=25 January 2002 |accessdate=25 February 2009}}</ref>

A longtime tennis enthusiast, John wrote the song "Philadelphia Freedom" in tribute to long-time friend [[Billie Jean King]] and her [[World Team Tennis]] franchise of the same name. John and King also co-host an annual pro-am event to benefit AIDS charities, most notably John's own [[Elton John AIDS Foundation]], for which King is a chairwoman.  John, who maintains a part-time residence in Atlanta, Georgia, became a fan of the [[Atlanta Braves]] baseball team when he moved there in 1991.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/content/printer_friendly/mlb/y2007/m09/d05/c2191343.jsp|title=Elton John goes to bat with Braves|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=31 January 2010}}</ref>

==Watford Football Club==
John became chairman and director of [[Watford Football Club]] in 1976, appointing [[Graham Taylor (footballer)|Graham Taylor]] as manager and investing large sums of money as the club rose three divisions into the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.watfordfc.com/page/History/0,,10400~65917,00.html | title= They shaped the club |publisher=watfordfc.com |accessdate=10 March 2010 }}</ref> The pinnacle of the club's success was finishing runners up in the First Division in 1983 and reaching the [[FA Cup Final]] a year later. He sold the club to [[Jack Petchey]] in 1987, but remained their lifelong president.<ref name=WAT/> In 1997 he re-purchased the club from Petchey and once again became chairman. He stepped down in 2002 when the club needed a full-time chairman although he continued as president of the club.<ref name=WAT/> Although no longer the majority shareholder, he still holds a significant financial interest. In June 2005 he held a concert at Watford's [[Vicarage Road]] ground, donating the funds to the club, and another concert in May 2010.<ref name=WAT>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/watford/8710452.stm Elton John gig boost for Watford] ''[[BBC|BBC Sport]]'' Retrieved 28 December 2010</ref> For a time{{when|date=August 2011}} he was also a part-owner of the [[Los Angeles Aztecs]] of the [[North American Soccer League]].

==AIDS Foundation==
{{Main|Elton John AIDS Foundation}}
John has been associated with AIDS charities since the deaths of his friends [[Ryan White]] and [[Freddie Mercury]], raising large amounts of money and using his public profile to raise awareness of the disease. For example, in 1986 he joined with [[Dionne Warwick]], [[Gladys Knight]], and [[Stevie Wonder]] to record the single "[[That's What Friends Are For]]", with all profits being donated to the [[American Foundation for AIDS Research]]. The song won John and the others the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] (as well as [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] for its writers, [[Burt Bacharach]] and [[Carole Bayer Sager]]). In April 1990, John performed "[[Skyline Pigeon]]" at the funeral of White, a teenage [[haemophiliac]] he had befriended.

John founded the Elton John AIDS Foundation in 1992 as a charity to fund programmes for HIV/AIDS prevention, for the elimination of prejudice and discrimination against HIV/AIDS-affected individuals, and for providing services to people living with or at risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. This cause continues to be one of his personal passions. In early 2006, John donated the smaller of two bright-red [[Yamaha (manufacturer)|Yamaha]] pianos from his [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], Nevada show to auction on eBay to raise public awareness and funds for the foundation.

To raise money for his AIDS charity, John hosts annually a glamorous White Tie & Tiara Ball, to which many famous celebrities are invited. On 28 June 2007, the 9th annual White Tie & Tiara Ball took place. The menu consisted of a [[tuber (genus)|truffle]] [[soufflé]] followed by Surf and Turf ([[filet mignon]] with [[Maine]] [[lobster]] tail) and a giant [[Knickerbocker glory]] ice cream. An auction followed the dinner held by [[Stephen Fry]]. A Rolls Royce ‘Phantom’ [[drophead]] coupe and a piece of [[Tracey Emin]]'s artwork both raised £800,000 for the charity fund, with the total amount raised reaching £3.5&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|last=Alexander |first=Hilary |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/main.jhtml?xml=/fashion/2007/06/29/efwhite129.xml |title=White tie and tiara ball – Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph |date=1 July 2007 |accessdate=25 February 2009 | location=London}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref> Later on in the event, John sang "[[Delilah (1968 song)|Delilah]]" with [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] and "[[Big Spender]]" with [[Shirley Bassey]].<ref>[http://www.chopard.com/worldwide/fl/eltonjohn07/eltonjohn2007.htm Chopard and Elton John – The White Tie and Tiara Ball 2007<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Dead link|date=February 2009}}</ref> Tickets for the Ball cost £1,000 a head.

==Activism==
On 1 April 2010, John joined [[Cyndi Lauper]] in the launch of her ''Give a Damn campaign'' to bring a wider awareness of discrimination of the [[LGBT]] community as part of her True Colors Fund.<ref name=DLM>{{cite news |title=True Blood star Anna Paquin reveals she's bisexual |author=Daily Mail Reporter |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1262918/True-Blood-star-Anna-Paquin-reveals-shes-bisexual.html |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |location=London |date=1 April 2010 |accessdate=16 August 2012}}</ref> In the advertisement, John states: "Imagine walking down the street and wondering if this is the day you'll get beaten up, or even killed, simply because of who you are".<ref name=DLM/> The campaign is to bring [[heterosexual|straight]] people to stand up with the gay, lesbian, bisexual, [[transgendered]] community and stop the discrimination.

Since 1970, John's band, of which he is the pianist and lead singer, has been known as the Elton John Band.<ref>The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll. p.501. Fireside, 2001</ref><ref>Mike Clifford, Pete Frame (1992). The Harmony Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rock. p. 88. Harmony Books, 1992</ref> The band has had multiple line-up changes, but [[Nigel Olsson]], [[Davey Johnstone]], and [[Ray Cooper]] have been members (albeit non-consecutively) since 1970 (Olsson) and 1972 (Johnstone and Cooper). Ray Cooper is on and off with the Elton John Band because he works with other musicians as a session and road-tour percussionist. Furthermore, John has also used a number of session musicians in the time of his career.
