'''Franz Ferdinand''' (18 December 1863&nbsp;– 28 June 1914) was an [[Archduke]] of [[Austria-Este]], Austro-Hungarian and Royal Prince of [[Hungary]] and of [[Bohemia]], and from 1889 until his death, [[heir presumptive]] to the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] throne.<ref>

He was born in [[Graz]], Austria, the eldest son of [[Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria]] (younger brother of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] and [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian]]) and of his second wife, [[Princess Maria Annunciata of Bourbon-Two Sicilies]]. When he was only twelve years old, his cousin [[Duke Francis V of Modena]] died, naming Franz Ferdinand his heir on condition that he add the name Este to his own. Franz Ferdinand thus became one of the wealthiest men in Austria.

==Heir presumptive==
In 1889, Franz Ferdinand's life changed dramatically.  His cousin [[Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria|Crown Prince Rudolf]] committed [[suicide]] at his hunting lodge in [[The Mayerling Incident|Mayerling]],<ref name="brook">

==Military career==
Franz Ferdinand, like most males in the ruling [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] line, entered the [[Austro-Hungarian Army|army]] from a young age.  He was frequently and rapidly promoted, given the rank of [[lieutenant]] at age fourteen, [[Captain (land)|captain]] at twenty-two, [[colonel]] at twenty-seven, and [[major general]] at thirty-one.<ref name="Rothenburg, G. 1976. p 141">Rothenburg, G. ''The Army of Francis Joseph''. West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 1976. p 141.</ref> While never receiving formal staff training, he was considered eligible for command and at one point briefly led the primarily Hungarian 9th [[Hussar]] Regiment.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=120}} In 1898 he was given a commission "at the special disposition of His Majesty" to make inquiries into all aspects of the military services and military agencies were commanded to share their papers with him.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=141}}

He exerted influence on the armed forces even when he did not hold a specific command through a military [[chancery]] that produced and received documents and papers on military affairs. This was headed by [[Alexander Brosch von Aarenau]] and eventually employed a staff of sixteen.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=141}}. 

Franz in 1913, as heir-presumptive to the elderly emperor, had been appointed inspector general of all the armed forces of Austria-Hungary (''Generalinspektor der gesamten bewaffneten Macht''), a position superior to that previously held by [[Archduke Albrecht, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Albrecht]] and including presumed command in wartime.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=170}}

==Marriage and family==
In 1894 Franz Ferdinand met Countess [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|Sophie Chotek]] at a ball in [[Prague]]. To be an eligible [[marriage]] partner for a member of the Imperial [[House of Habsburg]], one had to be a member of one of the reigning or formerly reigning dynasties of Europe. The Choteks were not one of these families, although they did include among their ancestors, in the [[female]] line, princes of [[Baden]], [[Hohenzollern-Hechingen]], and [[Liechtenstein]]. One of Sophie's direct ancestors was [[Albert IV, Count of Habsburg]]; she was descended from Elisabeth of Habsburg, a sister of King [[Rudolph I of Germany]]. Franz Ferdinand was a descendant of King Rudolph I. Sophie was a [[lady-in-waiting]] to [[Princess Isabella of Croy|Archduchess Isabella]], [[wife]] of [[Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen]]. Franz Ferdinand began to visit Archduke Friedrich's villa in Pressburg (now [[Bratislava]]). Sophie wrote to Franz Ferdinand during his convalescence from [[tuberculosis]] on the island of [[Lošinj]] in the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]]. They kept their relationship a secret for more than two years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Deeply in love, Franz Ferdinand refused to consider marrying anyone else. [[Pope Leo XIII]], Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]], and the [[Wilhelm II of Germany|German Emperor Wilhelm II]] all made representations on his behalf to Emperor [[Franz Joseph of Austria]], arguing that the disagreement between Franz Joseph and Franz Ferdinand was undermining the stability of the monarchy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Finally, in 1899, Emperor Franz Joseph agreed to permit Franz Ferdinand to marry Sophie, on condition that the marriage would be [[morganatic]] and that their descendants would not have succession rights to the throne.<ref name="brook"/><!-- pg. 126 -->  Sophie would not share her husband's rank, title, [[Order of precedence|precedence]], or privileges; as such, she would not normally appear in public beside him. She would not be allowed to ride in the royal carriage or sit in the royal box.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The wedding took place on 1 July 1900, at Reichstadt (now [[Zákupy]]) in [[Bohemia]]; Franz Joseph did not attend the affair, nor did any archduke including Franz Ferdinand's brothers.<ref name="brook"/><!-- pg. 126 --> The only members of the imperial family who were present were Franz Ferdinand's stepmother, [[Princess Maria Theresa of Braganza]], and her two daughters. Upon the marriage, Sophie was given the title "Princess of Hohenberg" (''Fürstin von Hohenberg'') with the style "Her Serene Highness" (''Ihre Durchlaucht'').  In 1909, she was given the more senior title "Duchess of Hohenberg" (''Herzogin von Hohenberg'') with the style "Her Highness" (''Ihre Hoheit''). This raised her status considerably, but she still yielded precedence at court to all the archduchesses. Whenever a function required the couple to gather with the other members of royalty, Sophie was forced to stand far down the line of importance, separated from her husband.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Franz Ferdinand's children were:
* [[Princess Sophie von Hohenberg]] (1901–1990), married Count Friedrich von Nostitz-Rieneck (1891–1973)
* [[Maximilian, Duke of Hohenberg]] (1902–1962), married Countess Elisabeth von Waldburg zu Wolfegg und Waldsee (1904–1993)
* [[Prince Ernst von Hohenberg]] (1904–1954), married Marie-Therese Wood (1910–1985)

==Character==
The German historian Michael Freund described Franz Ferdinand as "a man of uninspired energy, dark in appearance and emotion, who radiated an aura of strangeness and cast a shadow of violence and recklessness ... a true personality amidst the amiable inanity that characterized Austrian society at this time."<ref>Freund, Michael: Deutsche Geschichte. Die Große Bertelsmann Lexikon-Bibliothek, Bd. 7. C. Bertelsmann Verlag, 1961. p.901</ref> As his sometime admirer [[Karl Kraus]] put it, "he was not one who would greet you ... he felt no compulsion to reach out for the unexplored region which the Viennese call their heart."<ref>''Die Fackel''. Issue July 10, 1914</ref> His relations with Emperor Franz Joseph were tense; the emperor's personal servant recalled in his memoirs that "thunder and lightning always raged when they had their discussions."<ref>Ketterl, Eugen: Der alte Kaiser wie nur einer ihn sah. Cissy Klastersky (ed.), Gerold & Co., Vienna 1929</ref> The commentaries and orders which the heir to the throne wrote as margin notes to the documents of the Imperial central commission for architectural conservation (where he was Protector) reveal what can be described as "choleric conservativism."<ref>Brückler, Theodor: Franz Ferdinand als Denkmalpfleger.

Franz Ferdinand had a fondness for [[trophy hunting]] that was excessive even by the standards of European nobility of this time.<ref>Wladimir Aichelburg, ''Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand von Österreich-Este und Artstetten'', Vienna: Lehner, 2000, ISBN 9783901749186, [http://books.google.com/books?ei=Qa1GT7WTNu_aiQKc0rDaDQ&id=Kn8iAQAAIAAJ&dq=Franz+Ferdinand+Jagd&q=Tats%C3%A4chlich+war+Franz+Ferdinand+ein+au%C3%9Fergew%C3%B6hnlich+leidenschaftlicher+J%C3%A4ger%2C#search_anchor p. 31] {{de icon}}: "Tatsächlich war Franz Ferdinand ein außergewöhnlich leidenschaftlicher Jäger" - "It is a fact that Franz Ferdinand was an unusually passionate hunter".</ref> In his diaries he kept track of an estimated 300,000 game kills, 5,000 of which were [[deer]].

==Political views==
[[File:Greater austria.png|thumb|350px|Map of the [[United States of Greater Austria|federalization of Austria-Hungary]] planned by Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the member states with separate governments]]

Historians have disagreed on how to characterize the political philosophies of Franz Ferdinand, some attributing generally liberal views on the empire's nationalities while others have emphasized his dynastic centralism, Catholic conservatism, and tendency to clash with other leaders.<ref name="Rothenburg, G. 1976. p 141"/> He advocated granting greater autonomy to ethnic groups within the Empire and addressing their grievances, especially the Czechs in [[Bohemia]] and the Yugoslavic peoples in [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia]], who had been left out of the Austro-Hungarian compromise of 1867.<ref>

}}</ref> Yet his feelings towards the Hungarians were less generous; he regarded Magyar nationalism as a revolutionary threat to the Habsburg dynasty and reportedly became angry when officers of the 9th Hussars Regiment (which he commanded) spoke Magyar in his presence - despite the fact that it was the official regimental language.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=120}} He further regarded the Hungarian branch of the Dual Monarchy's army, the [[Military of Hungary|Honvédség]], as an unreliable and potentially threatening force within the empire, complaining at the Hungarians' failure to provide funds for the joint army{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=147}} and opposing the formation of artillery units within the Hungarian forces.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=133}} 

He also advocated a careful approach towards Serbia - repeatedly locking horns with [[Franz Conrad|Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf]], Vienna's hard-line Chief of the General Staff, warning that harsh treatment of [[Serbia]] would bring Austria-Hungary into open conflict with Russia, to the ruin of both Empires.

He was disappointed when Austria-Hungary failed to act as a Great Power, such as during the [[Boxer Rebellion]]; in 1900 other nations, including, in his description, "dwarf states like Belgium and Portugal",{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=136}} sent troops to protect Westerners and punish the Chinese, but Austria-Hungary did not.

Franz Ferdinand was a prominent and influential supporter of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in a time when sea power was not a priority in Austrian foreign policy and the Navy was relatively little known and supported by the public. After his assassination in 1914, the Navy honoured Franz Ferdinand and his wife with a [[lying in state]] aboard the [[SMS Viribus Unitis]].

On Sunday, 28 June 1914, at approximately 10:45 am, Franz Ferdinand and his wife were killed in [[Sarajevo]], the capital of the Austro-Hungarian province of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], by [[Gavrilo Princip]], 19 at the time, a member of [[Young Bosnia]] and one of a group of assassins organized by the [[Black Hand]].<ref name="johnson"/> The event led to a chain of events that eventually triggered [[World War I]].

The couple had previously been attacked when a grenade was thrown at their car. Ferdinand deflected the grenade and it detonated far behind them. He is known to have shouted in anger to local officials, "So you welcome your guests with bombs?!"<ref name ="beyer146">Beyer, Rick, ''The Greatest Stories Never Told'', A&E Television Networks / The History Channel, ISBN 0-06-001401-6. p. 146-147</ref>

The royal couple insisted on seeing all those injured at the hospital. After travelling there, Franz and Sophie decided to go to the palace, but their driver took a wrong turn onto a side street, where Princip spotted them.<ref name ="beyer146"/> As the car was backing up, Princip approached and shot Sophie in the abdomen and Franz Ferdinand in the jugular. He was still alive when witnesses arrived to render aid.<ref name="johnson"/> His dying words to Sophie were, 'Don't die darling, live for our children.'<ref name ="beyer146"/> Princip had used the  [[.32 ACP|Browning .32 ACP]] cartridge,<ref>{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Melvin Maynard|title=Automatic arms: their history, development and use|year=1941|publisher=W.

<blockquote>One bullet pierced Franz Ferdinand's neck while the other pierced Sophie's abdomen. ... As the car was reversing (to go back to the Governor's residence because the entourage thought the Imperial couple were unhurt) a thin streak of blood shot from the Archduke's mouth onto Count Harrach's right cheek (he was standing on the car's running board). Harrach drew out a handkerchief to still the gushing blood. The [[Duchess]], seeing this, called: "For Heaven's sake! What happened to you?" and sank from her seat, her face falling between her husband's knees.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Harrach and Potoriek ... thought she had fainted ... only her husband seemed to have an instinct for what was happening. Turning to his wife despite the bullet in his neck, Franz Ferdinand pleaded: "''Sopherl! Sopherl! Sterbe nicht! Bleibe am Leben für unsere Kinder!''  -  Sophie dear! Don't die! Stay alive for our children!". Having said this, he seemed to sag down himself. His plumed hat ... fell off; many of its green feathers were found all over the car floor. Count Harrach seized the Archduke by the uniform collar to hold him up. He asked "''Leiden Eure Kaiserliche Hoheit sehr?''  -  Is Your Imperial [[Highness]] suffering very badly?"  "Es ist nichts - It is nothing" said the Archduke in a weak but audible voice. He seemed to be losing consciousness during his last few minutes, but, his voice growing steadily weaker, he repeated the phrase perhaps six or seven times more.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
A [[Death rattle|rattle]] began to issue from his throat, which subsided as the car drew in front of the Konak bersibin (Town Hall).
Despite several doctors' efforts, the [[Archduke]] died shortly after being carried into the building while his beloved wife was almost certainly dead from internal bleeding before the motorcade reached the Konak.
</blockquote>

The assassinations, along with the [[arms race]], [[nationalism]], [[imperialism]], [[militarism]], and the alliance system all contributed to the [[origins of World War I]], which began less than two months after Franz Ferdinand's death, with Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia.<ref>Johnson. p. 56</ref> The assassination of Ferdinand is considered the most immediate cause of World War I.<ref>John McCannon, PhD. - ''AP World History''  - Copyright 2010, 2008, Barron's Educational Series, Inc. - page 9.</ref>

Franz Ferdinand is interred with his wife Sophie in [[Artstetten Castle]], Austria.
