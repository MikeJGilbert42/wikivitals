'''Joe Dean''' (born April 26, 1930) was an All-SEC basketball player for [[Louisiana State University]] from 1950&ndash;52 and later became the school's [[athletic director]], serving in the role from 1987&ndash;2000.

==Biography==
===Early life and playing career===
A native of New Albany, Ind., Dean was a starter on his high school team at [[New Albany High School (Indiana)|New Albany High School]], including a stint as the team's captain during his senior year.  Following high school, he chose to attend LSU, where he was a member of the [[LSU Tigers basketball|LSU basketball]] team from 1949 through 1952, earning All-SEC honors three times.  He was also a three-time member of the SEC All-Tournament Team, the only player to earn such distinction prior to the tournament's suspension in 1953 (it was later resumed in 1979). In the Spring of 2008, Dean was voted on to the LSU All-Decade Team for the 1950s in an online vote by fans at the school's official website. The next year, he was voted onto the LSU All-Century Team.<ref>http://www.lsusports.net/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=5200&ATCLID=3658786</ref>

Dean was the very first LSU player to be selected in the NBA Draft, taken 10th overall by the [[Indianapolis Olympians]] in the [[1952 NBA Draft]]. He instead chose to play for the Bartlesville Phillips 66ers of the [[National Industrial Basketball League]]. In the 1956 U.S. Olympic Trials, the 66ers won the tournament and were awarded five players to the U.S. Olympic Team. Dean, despite being fourth on the team in scoring in the tournament, was not one of the five choices. He was subsequently named an alternate to the team.<ref>[http://www.buchanbakers.com/gpage5.html 1956 Olympic Trials]</ref> In 1958, he was an NIBL All-Star.<ref>http://www.apbr.org/aau.html</ref>

===Dixie Basketball Camp===
In 1966, Dean began a basketball camp just outside of Baton Rouge, La., at Lake Side Oaks. Later, in 1974, he moved the camp to Southwest Mississippi Community College in Summit, Miss., where the camp has been held each July ever since. It is believed to be the longest running basketball camp in the United States.

===Broadcasting career===
Dean is most famous for his work as a [[color analyst]] for Southeastern Conference basketball games, which he covered for nearly 20 years. He coined the phrase "String Music" and is also known for other phrases such as, "Stufferino in Lexington, KY."  During his run, he worked with [[NBC]], [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]], [[ESPN]], [[TVS Television Network|TVS]] and [[Jefferson Pilot]].<ref>[http://www.lsusports.net/ViewArticle.dbml?&DB_OEM_ID=5200&ATCLID=160789&SPID=2178&SPSID=27898 Dean to Be Honored at SEC Men's Basketball Tournament]</ref>

===As athletic director at LSU===
Dean gave up announcing in April 1987, when he took over the athletic director post at his alma mater, LSU. He served from April 1987 through the end of the 2000 calendar year, with the LSU's [[2000 Peach Bowl]] victory over [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] being his last official event as athletic director. During his tenure, Dean oversaw arguably the greatest athletic era in school history. The LSU baseball team won five national championships (1991, 1993, 1996, 1997, 2000) while the men's and women's track teams accounted for 22 combined, including an unprecedented 11-consecutive NCAA Outdoor Track and Field championships by the women's team. At the time of his retirement, the 27 national championships under Dean's guidance were an SEC record.

The [[LSU Tigers football|LSU football team]] won one SEC Championship (1988), two SEC Western Division Championships (1996, 1997) and four bowl victories (1995, 1996, 1997, 2000) in his 14 years. However, Dean will often be remembered for an 11-year span from 1989&ndash;1999 in which the Tigers had eight losing campaigns. He also presided over the downfall of the basketball program, which led to the retirement of legendary head coach [[Dale Brown (basketball)|Dale Brown]], the SEC's second all-time winningest coach. Dean hired former Samford head coach John Brady to take Brown's place. After inheriting a program on probation, Brady guided LSU to the 2000 SEC Championship and 2006 Final Four before being fired during the 2008 season.

After Dean's 14 years, he was succeeded in 2001 by [[Skip Bertman]].

===Awards and honors===
In the Summer of 2007, Dean was named the [[18th most influential person in the history of the SEC by the Birmingham News]].<ref>[http://blog.al.com/bn/2007/07/secs_most_influential_the_top.html  SEC's Most Influential: The Top 25]</ref> He was also chosen as one of the [[top voices]]<ref>[http://blog.al.com/bn/2008/02/greatest_voices_of_the_southea.html  Greatest Voices of the Southeastern Conference]</ref> in the history of the conference, placing seventh according to the Birmingham News. The lists were created in honor of the league's 75th Anniversary.

Dean is a member of the [[Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame]],<ref>[http://www.hoopshall.com/inductees/1985/dean.html Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame]</ref> the NABC Hall of Fame, the Louisiana Hall of Fame and the LSU Hall of Fame.

===Personal life===
Dean is the father of Joe Dean, Jr., a well-respected athletic director at Division III Birmingham-Southern College in Birmingham, Ala. Joe Jr. played college basketball at Mississippi State. His other son Mark played collegiately at UL-Monroe (then Northeast Louisiana).
