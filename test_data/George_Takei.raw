'''George Hosato Takei Altman''' ({{IPA-en|təˈkeɪ|}} {{respell|tə|KAY|'}}; April 20, 1937) is an [[United States|American]] actor, best known for his role as [[Hikaru Sulu]], [[helmsman]] of the {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701|6}} in the television series ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. He is a proponent of [[LGBT social movements|gay rights]] and active in state and local politics as well as continuing his acting career. He has won several awards and accolades in his work on human rights and [[Japanese American]] relations, including his work with the [[Japanese American National Museum]].

==Early life==
Takei was born in [[Los Angeles, California]], the son of Fumiko Emily ([[married and maiden names|née]] [[Nakamura (surname)|Nakamura]]) and Takekuma Norman Takei, who worked in real estate.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/35/George-Takei.html George Takei Biography (1937-)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> His parents were [[Japanese American]].

He and his family returned to Los Angeles at the end of [[World War II]]. He attended Mount Vernon Junior High School, where he served as student body president, and [[Los Angeles High School]]. He was a member of Boy Scout Troop 379 of the [[Koyasan Buddhist Temple]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmnLYVNO5EE&NR=1|title=George Takei - Boy Scouts of America Public Service Announcement|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://corpsreps.com/corpsreps.cfm?view=corpshist&corps=534&corpstype=Junior|title=History for Commodore Perry Scouts|publisher=}}</ref>

Upon graduation from high school, Takei enrolled in the [[University of California, Berkeley]] where he studied architecture. Later he attended the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], where he received a [[Bachelor of Arts|bachelor of arts]] in theater in 1960 and a [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|master of arts]] in theater in 1964. He attended the [[Shakespeare Institute]] at [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] in England, and [[Sophia University]] in Tokyo, Japan. In [[Hollywood]], he studied acting at the [[Desilu Productions|Desilu Workshop]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.georgetakei.com/george-takei-biography.txt |title = George Takei Biography |publisher  = George Takei |author = |date = |accessdate = 2007-02-05}}</ref> Takei is fluent in English, Japanese, and Spanish.

==Early career==
Takei began his career in [[Hollywood]] in the late 1950s, at a time when Asian faces were rarely seen on American television and movie screens. His first role was providing voiceover for several characters in the English dub of Japanese monster films such as ''[[Godzilla Raids Again]]'' and ''[[Rodan (film)|Rodan]]'', followed by an appearance in the [[Emmy award]] winning television series ''[[Playhouse 90]]'' and Perry Mason ''The Case of the Blushing Pearls''. Takei subsequently appeared alongside such actors as [[Richard Burton]] in ''[[Ice Palace (film)|Ice Palace]]'', [[Jeffrey Hunter]] in ''[[Hell to Eternity]]'', [[Alec Guinness]] in ''[[A Majority of One]]'', [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]] in ''[[Red Line 7000]]'' and [[Cary Grant]] in ''[[Walk Don't Run]]''. He played Captain Nim, an [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]] LLDB (Luc Luong Dac Biet- Special Forces) officer alongside [[John Wayne]]'s character in the 1968 Vietnam War era film, ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]''. He starred in "[[The Encounter]]", a controversial episode of the Emmy Award winning television show ''[[The Twilight Zone]]''.

He had an uncredited role in the 1963 film ''[[PT 109 (film)|PT-109]]'' as the helmsman who steers the Japanese destroyer over [[John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy's]] [[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109|PT-109]]. He appeared in ''[[Walk Don't Run]]'' (1966) with [[Cary Grant]] and [[Samantha Eggar]] and he starred in an episode of ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'' during that show's first season in 1966. He also appeared in two [[Jerry Lewis]] comedies, ''[[The Big Mouth]]'' and ''[[Which Way to the Front?]]''

==''Star Trek''==
[[File:HikaruSulu.jpg|thumb|left|Takei as Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu]] In 1965, producer [[Gene Roddenberry]] cast him as Mr. Sulu in the second ''Star Trek'' pilot and eventually the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' television series. While working on the show he appeared as Captain Nim in ''The Green Berets''. It was intended that Sulu's role be expanded in the second season, but due to Takei's part in ''Green Berets'', he only appeared in half the season, with his role being filled by [[Walter Koenig]] as [[Pavel Chekov]]. When Takei returned, the two had to share a dressing room and a single episode script.<ref>''William Shatner's Star Trek Memories'' – documentary film, released 1995.</ref> Takei admitted in an interview that he initially felt threatened by Walter's presence, but later grew to be friends with him as the image of the officers sharing the ship's helm panel side-by-side became iconic.

Takei has since appeared in numerous TV and film productions, including the first six ''Star Trek'' motion pictures, and today he is a regular on the [[science fiction convention]] circuit throughout the world. He has also acted and provided voice acting for several science fiction [[Video game|computer games]], including ''[[Freelancer (video game)|Freelancer]]'' and numerous ''Star Trek'' games. In 1996, in honor of the 30th anniversary of ''Star Trek'', he reprised his role as Captain [[Hikaru Sulu]] on an episode of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', appearing as a memory of Lt. [[Tuvok]], who served on the [[USS Excelsior (Star Trek)|USS ''Excelsior'']] under Sulu, during the events of ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]''.

Takei is one of a number of ''Star Trek'' supporting cast members whose difficulties with [[William Shatner]] have become public.<ref>William Shatner & Chris Kreski, ''Star Trek Memories''. New York: Harper Paperbacks, 1989, ISBN 0-06-166469-3</ref><ref>George Takei ''To the Stars: The Autobiography of George Takei, Star Trek's Mr. Sulu''.

No one could have done Kirk the way Bill did. His energy and his determination, that's Bill. And that's also Captain Kirk." He appeared alongside Shatner on the 2006 [[Comedy Central]] ''Roast of William Shatner'' in which the two mocked each other in good humor and embraced, Takei noting that he was "honored" to be there "despite our past tensions".

In a radio interview on ''[[The Adam Carolla Show (terrestrial radio)|The Adam Carolla Show]]'' on June 19, 2008, Takei implied that part of his problems with Shatner began when he came out of the closet for the first time and his sexuality was accepted by almost everyone on the cast and crew of ''Star Trek'' except Shatner. Shatner was a guest on the same radio show some weeks earlier and expressed complete bewilderment as to why George Takei has such difficulties with him. According to Shatner, he has asked Takei repeatedly over the years to discuss his differences with him, but has been repeatedly rebuffed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Takei is also one of six actors (the other actors being [[Jonathan Frakes]], [[Kate Mulgrew]], [[Michael Dorn]], [[Avery Brooks]] and [[Majel Barrett]]) to lend his voice to ''[[Star Trek: Captain's Chair]]'', reprising his role of Captain Hikaru Sulu when users visit the bridge of the original ''Enterprise'' in the computer game.

In the summer of 2007, Takei reprised his role of Sulu in the fan-made Internet based series ''[[Star Trek: Phase II (fan series)|Star Trek New Voyages: Phase II]]''.<ref>{{Cite news

==After ''Star Trek''==

===1970s===
In 1972, Takei was an alternate delegate from California to the [[1972 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]]. The following year he ran for [[City Council of Los Angeles]], finishing second, losing by just 1,647 votes. During the campaign, Takei's bid for the city councilman's seat caused one local station to stop running the repeats of the original ''Star Trek'' series until after the election and [[KNBC]]-TV to substitute the premiere episode of the [[Star Trek: The Animated Series|''Star Trek'' animated series]] scheduled by the network with another in which his character did not appear, in attempts to avoid violating the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC's]] [[equal-time rule]]. The other candidates in the race complained that Takei's distinctive and powerful voice alone, even without his image on television every week, created an unfair advantage.

[[Los Angeles Mayor]] [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]] later appointed Takei to the board of directors of the [[Southern California Rapid Transit District]], making him part of the team that initiated and planned the Los Angeles [[Rapid transit|subway]] system. Takei was called away from the set of ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' in 1978 to cast the tie-breaking vote for the creation of the Los Angeles subway system. He served on the board from 1973 to 1984.<ref>http://www.georgetakei.com/bio.asp</ref>

Also during this period Takei began his friendship with the future Mayor of [[West Hollywood]] and current member of the [[Los Angeles City Council]] [[Paul Koretz]].{{fact|date=February 2012}}

In 1979, Takei with [[Robert Asprin]] co-wrote the science-fiction novel ''Mirror Friend, Mirror Foe''.<ref>{{Cite book

===1990s===
In 1994, Takei published his autobiography, "To the Stars".<ref>{{cite web |title=To the Stars: The Autobiography of George Takei, Star Trek's Mr. Sulu (9780671890094): George Takei: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |asin=0671890093}}</ref> At one point he had hoped to do a movie or telefilm based on chapters dealing with the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, of which he had personal experience.

===2000s===
He guest starred on an episode of ''[[Will & Grace]]'' as himself, after he came out as gay for the first time on television.

In August 2006, Takei was a guest on the [[Comedy Central]] [[Roast (comedy)|Roast]] of William Shatner. He sat on the [[dais]], and was one of the many people who took part in the roasting, in which he took the time to verbally poke fun at Shatner.

In January 2007, Takei began appearing on ''[[Heroes (TV series)|Heroes]]'', as Kaito Nakamura, a successful Japanese businessman and father to one of the main characters, time/space-travelling [[Hiro Nakamura]], who also happens to be an obsessive fan of ''Star Trek''. In the first episode Takei is portrayed, [[Distractions (Heroes)|"Distractions"]], the license plate of the limo he arrives in is [[NCC-1701]], another reference to the ''Star Trek'' series. "Nakamura" is also George's mother's maiden name. He appeared in all four seasons. 

Takei made an appearance on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live]]'' in a mock public service announcement to show his disappointment over basketball star [[Tim Hardaway]]'s homophobic remarks. Takei, speaking for the gay community, explained "We don't hate you. As a matter of fact, we like you. We like you very much." Takei then compliments Hardaway's calves and shaved head, letting his hand linger over the crotch of Hardaway's image. Takei ends by letting it be known that one day, when Hardaway least expects it, Takei will have sex with him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/video_dog/comedy/2007/02/20/jimmy_kimmel_takei_hardaway/index.html|title=George Takei's Message to Tim Hardaway|date=2007-02-20}}</ref>

Takei appeared on the first episode of ''[[Secret Talents of the Stars]]'', singing [[country music]] but was not selected to proceed to the next stage. However the point became moot as the series was abruptly cancelled after the opening episode.

In 2008 he appeared on the 8th season of the reality TV series [[I'm a Celebrity... Get Me out of Here! (Series 8 UK)|''I'm a Celebrity... Get Me out of Here!'']] on [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Television]]. He lived in the Australian bush for 21 days and nights, doing tasks along with fellow campers in order to gain better meals and survive eviction from the show. His politeness and calmness made him popular with the other campers. Out of 15 participants the British public voted him into 3rd place behind 2nd placed [[Martina Navratilova]] and winner [[Joe Swash]].

In April 2009, he voiced a fictitious version of himself in the NASA animated short "Robot Astronomy Talk Show: Gravity and the Great Attractor", part of the web-series [[IRrelevant Astronomy]] produced by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. Later that year, he voiced another fictitious version of himself in a downloadable add-on available for the [[Playstation Network]]'s ''[[Pain (video game)|Pain]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.painthegame.com/Characters/GEORGE_TAKEI.html|title= Bio George Takei}}</ref>

In 2009, Takei and his husband Brad Altman appeared in a documentary short titled ''George & Brad in Bed'' that profiled their relationship.<ref>Internet Movie Database: [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1513774/ "George & Brad in Bed (2009)"], accessed June 29, 2010</ref>

In 2009, Takei was a guest on [[NPR]]'s ''[[Wait, Wait...Don't Tell Me!]]''.

===2010s===
In 2010, Takei recorded a series of PSAs for the Social Security Administration to help promote applying online for benefits.

He also starred in ''[[Mr. and Mrs.|All Star Mr and Mrs]]'', a show on [[ITV]] in Britain presented by [[Philip Schofield]] and [[Fern Britton]] in 2011, with partner Brad Altman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/entertainment/quiz/mrandmrs/default.html|title=All Star Mr and Mrs|publisher=itv.com}}</ref>

Takei was also one of the celebrities on the 12th series of ''[[The Apprentice (TV series)|The Apprentice]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apprentice_%28U.S._season_12%29|title=Wikipedia article on the 12th season of The Apprentice}}</ref> but was fired in the episode which aired on March 4, 2012.

Takei marked the 70th anniversary of the internment of Americans of Japanese descent, including himself as a child, by asking his readers to contact Congress to block "S. 1253, the National Defense Authorization Act... that would let any U.S. president use the military to arrest and imprison without charge or trial anyone suspected of having any relationship with a terrorist organization."<ref name="Never Again">{{cite web |author=George Takei |title=Never Forget. Never Again|url=http://www.allegiancemusical.com/video/never-again |accessdate=February 20, 2012}}</ref>

In 2012, Takei's Facebook page has accumulated 1.3 million fans, and has become a focal distribution point for various internet humor items and memes.

Takei was featured with [[Martin Sheen]] and [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] in a performance of [[Dustin Lance Black]]'s play, ''[[8 (play)|'8']]'' — a staged reenactment of the [[Perry v. Brown|federal trial]] that overturned California's [[Proposition 8|Prop 8 ban]] on same-sex marriage — as [[William Tam]].<ref name="8 the play">{{cite news |title=‘Glee’ Stars ‘Touched’ By Pitt & Clooney’s Support Of ‘8’ |url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/jesse-tyler-ferguson/glee-stars-touched-by-brad-pitt-and-george-clooneys-support-of-8_article_61543|publisher=[[Access Hollywood]]. accesshollywood.com|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}</ref> The production was held at the [[Wilshire Ebell Theatre]] and broadcast on YouTube to raise money for the [[American Foundation for Equal Rights]].<ref name="8 play video">{{cite web|title="8": A Play about the Fight for Marriage Equality|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlUG8F9uVgM|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=YouTube to broadcast Proposition 8 play live|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/03/01/youtube-to-broadcast-proposition-8-play-live/|publisher=pinknews.co.uk|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}</ref>

===''The Howard Stern Show''===
Takei's first appearance on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' was in late 1990 and was featured in ''[[The History of Howard Stern]]'', a radio show documenting the life and career of [[Howard Stern]]. On September 27, 1994, Takei would appear via satellite feed to promote his book ''To the Stars...''. Clips of Takei from his audio book and television interviews would later be played on the show, with prank calls and comedy bits being made using them.

On January 9, 2006, it was announced that Takei would be the new announcer for the show when it moved to [[Sirius XM Radio]]. Takei sat in the studio for the first week of broadcasts, and to this day sits in for a week of shows every few months.

In June 2006, Takei accepted a Freedom of Speech Award on behalf of Stern, with the award being presented by ''[[Talkers (magazine)|Talkers Magazine]]''. Takei was in the studio again for two days in late September 2006 where he discussed his participation in an episode of ''[[Star Trek: New Voyages]]'' as well as his participation in the film ''[[The Great Buck Howard]]''. In a visit in December 2007, Stern stated that Takei was the only cast member who got universally positive feedback from audience e-mails; even listeners who claim to dislike ''[[Star Trek]]'' enjoy Takei's contributions. The show staff has stated that they like his upfront sense of humor and his willingness to talk about almost any issue openly and freely, particularly now that the show is uncensored on Sirius XM.

Takei has developed a friendly relationship with Stern cast member [[Artie Lange]], whom Takei affectionately calls his "cuddly muffin." The two have become friends despite Lange's notorious penchant for his supposedly "homophobic" humor. Lange revealed on the air that George sent him a "lovely card" praising his guest performance on a 2007 episode of ''[[Entourage (TV series)|Entourage]]'', in which Takei expressed the desire to one day act alongside Lange, and that the two talk at least once a week by telephone.

==Personal life==
[[File:George Takei Chicago Gay & Lesbian Pride 2006.jpg|thumb|right|George Takei at the [[Chicago Pride Parade]] in 2006]]
In October 2005, Takei revealed in an issue of ''[[Frontiers (magazine)|Frontiers]]'' magazine that he is [[gay]] and had been in a committed relationship with his partner, Brad Altman, for eighteen years. He said, "It's not really [[coming out]], which suggests opening a door and stepping through. It's more like a long, long walk through what began as a narrow corridor that starts to widen."<ref>{{Cite news

We are just like straight people, in terms of our outward appearance and our behavior. The only difference is that we are oriented to people of our own gender." Takei also described Altman as "a saint" for helping to take care of Takei's terminally ill mother.

Takei currently serves as a spokesperson for the [[Human Rights Campaign]] "[[National Coming Out Day|Coming Out Project]]." In 2006 he embarked on a nationwide "Equality Trek" speaking tour sharing his life as a gay [[Japanese American]], his eighteen year relationship with Altman, Frontrunners, and ''Star Trek'', encouraging others to share their own personal stories.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.hrc.org/takei/

This was aired on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live]]''.

Takei's marriage is one of thousands of same-sex marriages that took place at a time when same-sex marriage was legal in California. The California Supreme Court ruled that [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]], which banned same-sex marriage in California, did not affect Takei's marriage and other same-sex marriages entered into before its passing on November 4, 2008.

In May 2011, in response to a Tennessee State Legislature bill that prohibited school teachers or students from using any language that alludes to the existence of homosexuality (the "Don't Say Gay" bill), George Takei released [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRkIWB3HIEs another PSA] in which he offered up his name, suggesting that people could just substitute that for 'gay'.  For example, they could support ''Takei Marriage'' or watch ''Takei Pride Parades''; or even use slurs like ''That's so Takei''.

Takei is an avid [[Anglophile]]. On his personal website he had this to say: "Those who know me know that I am an inconvertible Anglophile – or more broadly, a Britanophile, which includes my affection for Scotland and Wales as well. I love things British. My car is British. My wardrobe, to a good extent, is British. I even love the food in London – I think British food has shaken its prevailing perception as indigestible and become quite wonderful. I try to get to Britain for holidays as often as I can. I love things British."<ref>[http://www.georgetakei.com/news-2003-march.asp An Anglophile Angeleno], George Takei Official Website, Blog, March, 2003. Retrieved Nov 2010.</ref>
