'''Hippocrates of Cos''' or '''Hippokrates of Kos''' ({{lang-grc|Ἱπποκράτης}}; Hippokrátēs; c. 460 BC – c. 370 BC) was an [[Ancient Greek|ancient]] [[Greeks|Greek]] [[physician]] of the [[Age of Pericles]] (Classical Greece), and is considered one of the most outstanding figures in the [[history of medicine]]. He is referred to as the [[List of persons considered father or mother of a scientific field#Medicine and physiology|father of Western medicine]]<ref>{{cite pmid|18392218}}</ref><ref>[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761576397/Hippocrates.html Hippocrates], Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2006.

This intellectual school revolutionized [[medicine in ancient Greece]], establishing it as a discipline distinct from other fields that it had traditionally been associated with (notably [[theurgy]] and [[philosophy]]), thus establishing medicine as a profession.<ref name="garrison9293">{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|pp=92–93}}</ref><ref name="nuland5">{{Harvnb|Nuland|1988|p=5}}</ref>

However, the achievements of the writers of the [[Hippocratic Corpus|Corpus]], the practitioners of Hippocratic medicine, and the actions of Hippocrates himself are often commingled; thus very little is known about what Hippocrates actually thought, wrote, and did. Hippocrates is commonly portrayed as the [[wikt:paragon|paragon]] of the ancient physician, credited with coining the [[Hippocratic Oath]], still relevant and in use today. He is also credited with greatly advancing the systematic study of [[clinical medicine]], summing up the medical knowledge of previous schools, and prescribing practices for physicians through the Hippocratic Corpus and other works.<ref name="garrison9293"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=96}}</ref>

==Biography==
[[Image:Kos Asklepeion.jpg|300px|thumb|''[[Asklepieion]]'' on [[Kos]]]]

Historians agree that Hippocrates was born around the year 460 BC on the [[Greece|Greek]] island of [[Kos]] (Cos), and became a famous ambassador for medicine against the strong opposing infrastructure of Greece. For this opposition he endured a twenty-year prison sentence during which he wrote well known medical works such as ''The Complicated Body'', encompassing many of the things we know to be true today. Other biographical information, however, is likely to be untrue (''see [[Hippocrates#Legends|Legends]]'').<ref name="nuland4">{{Harvnb|Nuland|1988|p=4}}</ref>

[[Soranus of Ephesus]], a 2nd-century Greek [[gynecologist]],<ref name="BC">{{Harvnb|Britannica|2006}}</ref> was Hippocrates' first biographer and is the source of most personal information about him. Information about Hippocrates can also be found in the writings of [[Aristotle]], which date from the 4th century BC, in the ''[[Suda]]'' of the 10th century AD, and in the works of [[John Tzetzes]], which date from the 12th century AD.<ref name="garrison9293"/><ref name="nuland7">{{Harvnb|Nuland|1988|p=7}}</ref>

Soranus wrote that Hippocrates' father was Heraclides, a physician, and his mother was Praxitela, daughter of Tizane. The two sons of Hippocrates, [[Thessalus (physician)|Thessalus]] and [[Draco (physician)|Draco]], and his son-in-law, [[Polybus (physician)|Polybus]], were his students. According to [[Galen]], a later physician, Polybus was Hippocrates' true successor, while Thessalus and Draco each had a son named [[Hippocrates (physician)|Hippocrates]].<ref name="adams19">{{Harvnb|Adams|1891|p=19}}</ref><ref name="margotta66">{{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=66}}</ref>

Soranus said that Hippocrates learned medicine from his father and grandfather, and studied other subjects with [[Democritus]] and [[Gorgias]]. Hippocrates was probably trained at the [[Asclepieion|asklepieion]] of [[Kos]], and took lessons from the [[Thrace|Thracian]] physician [[Herodicus|Herodicus of Selymbria]]. The only contemporaneous mention of Hippocrates is in [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'', where Plato describes Hippocrates as "Hippocrates of Kos, the [[Asclepiad (Greek)|Asclepiad]]."<ref name="marti86">{{Harvnb|Martí-Ibáñez|1961|pp=86–87}}</ref><ref name="plato">{{Harvnb|Plato|380 B.C.}}</ref> Hippocrates taught and practiced medicine throughout his life, traveling at least as far as [[Thessaly]], [[Thrace]], and the [[Sea of Marmara]].<ref name="margotta66"/> Several different accounts of his death exist. He died,probably in [[Larissa]], at the age of 83, 85 or 90, though some say he lived to be well over 100.<ref name="margotta66"/>

==Hippocratic theory==
{{Quote box

| align = right
| quote = "It is thus with regard divine nor more sacred than other diseases, but has a natural cause from the originates like other affections. Men regard its nature and cause as divine from ignorance and wonder..."
| source = ''On the Sacred Disease''<ref>{{Harvnb|Plato|400 B.C.}}</ref>
}}
Hippocrates is credited with being the first person to believe that diseases were caused naturally, not because of superstition and gods. Hippocrates was credited by the disciples of [[Pythagoras]] of allying philosophy and medicine.<ref name="philosophy">{{Harvnb|Adams|1891|p=4}}</ref> He separated the discipline of medicine from religion, believing and arguing that disease was not a punishment inflicted by the [[Greek gods|gods]] but rather the product of environmental factors, diet, and living habits. Indeed there is not a single mention of a mystical illness in the entirety of the Hippocratic Corpus. However, Hippocrates did work with many convictions that were based on what is now known to be incorrect [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]], such as [[Humorism]].<ref name="jones11">{{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=11}}</ref><ref name="nuland8">{{Harvnb|Nuland|1988|pp=8–9}}</ref><ref name="garrison9394">{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|pp=93–94}}</ref>

Ancient Greek schools of medicine were split (into the Knidian and Koan) on how to deal with disease. The [[Knidos|Knidian]] school of medicine focused on diagnosis.  Medicine at the time of Hippocrates knew almost nothing of human anatomy and physiology because of the Greek [[taboo]] forbidding the dissection of humans. The Knidian school consequently failed to distinguish when one disease caused many possible series of symptoms.<ref name="adams15">{{Harvnb|Adams|1891|p=15}}</ref> The Hippocratic school or [[Kos|Koan]] school achieved greater success by applying general [[medical diagnosis|diagnoses]] and passive treatments. Its focus was on patient care and [[prognosis]], not [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]]. It could effectively treat diseases and allowed for a great development in clinical practice.<ref name="margotta67">{{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=67}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Leff|Leff|1956|p=51}}</ref>

Hippocratic medicine and its philosophy are far removed from that of modern medicine. Now, the physician focuses on specific diagnosis and specialized treatment, both of which were espoused by the Knidian school. This shift in medical thought since Hippocrates' day has caused serious criticism over the past two millennia, with the passivity of Hippocratic treatment being the subject of particularly strong denunciations;<!--It seems to me that something is missing here. Hippocrates used methods that succeeded at his time, when medical knowledge was insufficiently advanced to allow for diagnoses or specialized treatments; at that time, attending to the general wellness of the patient was often the best way to allow their own immune system to fight off a disease. I'm almost certain I've seen this opinion in writing somewhere, and if it can be found it should be included.--> for example, the [[French people|French]] doctor M. S. Houdart called the Hippocratic treatment a "meditation upon death".<ref name="jones1213">{{Harvnb|Jones|1868|pp=12–13}}</ref>

===Humorism and crisis===
{{main|Humorism}}

Another important concept in Hippocratic medicine was that of a ''crisis'', a point in the progression of disease at which either the illness would begin to triumph and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite would occur and natural processes would make the patient recover. After a crisis, a relapse might follow, and then another deciding crisis. According to this doctrine, crises tend to occur on ''critical days'', which were supposed to be a fixed time after the contraction of a disease. If a crisis occurred on a day far from a ''critical day'', a relapse might be expected. Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him.<ref name="jones464859">{{Harvnb|Jones|1868|pp=46,48,59}}</ref>

[[Image:HippocraticBench.png|thumb|300px|A drawing of a [[Hippocratic bench]] from a [[Byzantine]] edition of [[Galen]]'s work in the 2nd century AD]]

Hippocratic medicine was humble and passive. The therapeutic approach was based on "the healing power of nature" ("''[[vis medicatrix naturae]]''" in [[Latin]]). According to this doctrine, the body contains within itself the power to re-balance the four humours and heal itself (''physis'').<ref name="garrison99">{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=99}}</ref> Hippocratic therapy focused on simply easing this natural process. To this end, Hippocrates believed "rest and immobilization [were] of capital importance."<ref name="margotta73">{{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=73}}</ref> In general, the Hippocratic medicine was very kind to the patient; treatment was gentle, and emphasized keeping the patient clean and sterile. For example, only clean water or wine were ever used on wounds, though "dry" treatment was preferable. Soothing [[Liniment|balms]] were sometimes employed.<ref name="garrison98">{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=98}}</ref>

Hippocrates was reluctant to administer drugs and engage in specialized treatment that might prove to be wrongly chosen; generalized therapy followed a generalized diagnosis.<ref name="garrison98"/><ref name="sing35">{{Harvnb|Singer|Underwood|1962|p=35}}</ref> However, potent drugs were used on certain occasions.<ref name="britannica">{{Harvnb|Encyclopædia Britannica|1911}}</ref> This passive approach was very successful in treating relatively simple ailments such as broken bones which required [[Traction (orthopedics)|traction]] to stretch the skeletal system and relieve pressure on the injured area. The [[Hippocratic bench]] and other devices were used to this end.

One of the strengths of Hippocratic medicine was its emphasis on [[prognosis]]. At Hippocrates' time, medicinal therapy was quite immature, and often the best thing that physicians could do was to evaluate an illness and predict its likely progression based upon data collected in detailed case histories.<ref name="garrison9394"/><ref name="garrison97">{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=97}}</ref>

===Professionalism===
[[Image:Ancientgreek surgical.jpg|thumb|A number of ancient Greek surgical tools. On the left is a [[trephine]]; on the right, a set of [[scalpel]]s. Hippocratic medicine made good use of these tools.<ref name="adams17">{{Harvnb|Adams|1891|p=17}}</ref>]]

Hippocratic medicine was notable for its strict professionalism, discipline, and rigorous practice.<ref name="garrison">{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966}}</ref> The Hippocratic work ''On the Physician'' recommends that physicians always be well-kempt, honest, calm, understanding, and serious. The Hippocratic physician paid careful attention to all aspects of his practice: he followed detailed specifications for, "lighting, personnel, instruments, positioning of the patient, and techniques of bandaging and splinting" in the ancient [[operating room]].<ref name="margotta64">{{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=64}}</ref> He even kept his [[fingernail]]s to a precise length.<ref name="rutkow24">{{Harvnb|Rutkow|1993|pp=24–25}}</ref>

The Hippocratic School gave importance to the clinical doctrines of observation and documentation. These doctrines dictate that physicians record their findings and their medicinal methods in a very clear and objective manner, so that these records may be passed down and employed by other physicians.<ref name="margotta66"/> Hippocrates made careful, regular note of many symptoms including complexion, pulse, fever, pains, movement, and excretions.<ref name="garrison97"/> He is said to have measured a patient's pulse when taking a case history to know if the patient lied.<ref name="marti88">{{Harvnb|Martí-Ibáñez|1961|p=88}}</ref> Hippocrates extended clinical observations into family history and environment.<ref name="margotta68">{{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=68}}</ref> "To him medicine owes the art of clinical inspection and observation."<ref name="garrison9394"/> For this reason, he may more properly be termed as the "Father of Medicine".<ref>{{Harvnb|Leff|Leff|1956|p=45}}</ref>

==Direct contributions to medicine==
[[Image:ClubbingFingers1.jpg|thumb|Clubbing of fingers in a patient with [[Eisenmenger's syndrome]]; first described by Hippocrates, clubbing is also known as "Hippocratic fingers"]]

Hippocrates and his followers were first to describe many diseases and medical conditions. He is given credit for the first description of [[Nail clubbing|clubbing]] of the fingers, an important diagnostic sign in chronic suppurative lung disease, [[lung cancer]] and [[Cyanotic heart defect|cyanotic heart disease]]. For this reason, clubbed fingers are sometimes referred to as "Hippocratic fingers".<ref name="schwartz">{{Harvnb|Schwartz|Richards|Goyal|2006}}</ref> Hippocrates was also the first physician to describe [[Hippocratic face]] in ''Prognosis''. [[Shakespeare]] famously alludes to this description when writing of [[Falstaff]]'s death in Act II, Scene iii. of ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''.<ref name="sing40">{{Harvnb|Singer|Underwood|1962|p=40}}</ref><ref name="margotta70">{{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=70}}</ref>

Hippocrates began to categorize illnesses as [[Acute (medical)|acute]], [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]], [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] and [[epidemic]], and use terms such as, "exacerbation, [[relapse]], resolution, crisis, [[paroxysm]], peak, and [[convalescence]]."<ref name="garrison97"/><ref name="mart90">{{Harvnb|Martí-Ibáñez|1961|p=90}}</ref> Another of Hippocrates' major contributions may be found in his descriptions of the symptomatology, physical findings, surgical treatment and prognosis of [[Empyema|thoracic empyema]], i.e. [[suppuration]] of the lining of the chest cavity. His teachings remain relevant to present-day students of [[Pulmonology|pulmonary medicine]] and surgery.<ref name="major">{{Harvnb|Major|1965}}</ref> Hippocrates was the first documented [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|chest surgeon]] and his findings and techniques, while crude, such as the use of lead pipes to drain chest wall abscess, are still valid.<ref name="major" />

The Hippocratic school of medicine described well the ailments of the human [[rectum]] and the treatment thereof, despite the school's poor theory of medicine. [[Hemorrhoids]], for instance, though believed to be caused by an excess of bile and phlegm, were treated by Hippocratic physicians in relatively advanced ways.<ref name="johann11">{{Harvnb|Jóhannsson|2005|p=11}}</ref><ref name="jani">{{Harvnb|Jani|2005|pp=24–25}}</ref> [[Cautery]] and [[surgery|excision]] are described in the Hippocratic Corpus, in addition to the preferred methods: [[Ligature (medicine)|ligating]] the hemorrhoids and drying them with a hot iron. Other treatments such as applying various salves are suggested as well.<ref name="johann12">{{Harvnb|Jóhannsson|2005|p=12}}</ref><ref name="book">{{Harvnb|Mann|2002|pp=1, 173}}</ref> Today, "treatment [for hemorrhoids] still includes burning, strangling, and excising."<ref name="johann11"/> Also, some of the fundamental concepts of [[proctoscopy]] outlined in the Corpus are still in use.<ref name="johann11"/><ref name="jani"/> For example, the uses of the rectal [[speculum (medical)|speculum]], a common medical device, are discussed in the Hippocratic Corpus.<ref name="jani"/> This constitutes the earliest recorded reference to [[endoscopy]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Shah|2002|p=645}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|NCEPOD|2004|p=4}}</ref>

==Hippocratic Corpus==
{{main|Hippocratic Corpus}}
[[Image:HippocraticOath.jpg|thumb|left|A 12th-century [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] manuscript of the Oath in the form of a [[cross]]]]

The Hippocratic Corpus (Latin: ''Corpus Hippocraticum'') is a collection of around seventy early medical works from [[Alexandrian period|Alexandrian Greece]].<ref name="Iniesta2011">{{Citation |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d688.short?rss=1 |title=Hippocratic Corpus |first=Ivan |last=Iniesta |date=20 April 2011 |doi=10.1136/bmj.d688 |journal=BMJ |volume=342 |pages=d688 |postscript=.}}</ref> It is written in [[Ionic dialect|Ionic Greek]]. The question of whether Hippocrates himself was the author of the corpus has not been conclusively answered,<ref name="singer27">{{Harvnb|Singer|Underwood|1962|p=27}}</ref> but the volumes were probably produced by his students and followers.<ref name="hanson">{{Harvnb|Hanson|2006}}</ref> Because of the variety of subjects, writing styles and apparent date of construction, scholars believe Hippocratic Corpus could not have been written by one person ([[Ermerins]] numbers the authors at nineteen).<ref name="britannica">{{Harvnb|Britannica|britannica}}</ref> The corpus was attributed to Hippocrates in antiquity, and its teaching generally followed his principles; thus it came to be known by his name. It might be the remains of a library of Kos, or a collection compiled in the 3rd century BC in [[Alexandria]].<ref name="marti86"/><ref name="margotta64"/>

The Hippocratic Corpus contains textbooks, lectures, research, notes and philosophical essays on various subjects in medicine, in no particular order.<ref name="singer27"/><ref name="rutkow23">{{Harvnb|Rutkow|p=23}}</ref> These works were written for different audiences, both specialists and laymen, and were sometimes written from opposing view points; significant contradictions can be found between works in the Corpus.<ref name="sing28">{{Harvnb|Singer|Underwood|1962|p=28}}</ref> Notable among the treatises of the Corpus are ''[[Hippocratic Oath|The Hippocratic Oath]]''; ''The Book of Prognostics''; ''On Regimen in Acute Diseases''; ''[[Aphorisms]]''; ''On Airs, Waters and Places''; ''Instruments of Reduction''; ''On The Sacred Disease''; etc.<ref name="britannica"/>

===Hippocratic Oath===
{{main|Hippocratic Oath}}
The [[Hippocratic Oath]], a seminal document on the [[ethics]] of medical practice, was attributed to Hippocrates in antiquity although new information shows it may have been written after his death. This is probably the most famous document of the Hippocratic Corpus. Recently the authenticity of the document's author has come under scrutiny. While the Oath is rarely used in its original form today, it serves as a foundation for other, similar [[oath]]s and laws that define good medical practice and morals. Such derivatives are regularly taken today by medical graduates about to enter medical practice.<ref name="marti86"/><ref name="jones217">{{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=217}}</ref><ref>Buqrat Aur Uski Tasaneef by [[Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman]], Tibbia College Magazine, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, India, 1966, p. 56-62.</ref>

Hippocrates is widely considered to be the "Father of Medicine".<ref name="hanson"/> His contributions revolutionized the practice of medicine; but after his death the advancement stalled.<ref name="garrison100">{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=100}}</ref> So revered was Hippocrates that his teachings were largely taken as too great to be improved upon and no significant advancements of his methods were made for a long time.<ref name="marti86"/><ref name="margotta73"/> The centuries after Hippocrates' death were marked as much by retrograde movement as by further advancement. For instance, "after the Hippocratic period, the practice of taking clinical case-histories died out," according to [[Fielding H. Garrison|Fielding Garrison]].<ref name="garrison95">{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=95}}</ref>

After Hippocrates, the next significant physician was [[Galen]], a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] who lived from AD. 129 to AD. 200. Galen perpetuated Hippocratic medicine, moving both forward and backward.<ref name="jones35">{{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=35}}</ref> In the [[Middle Ages]], the Islamic world adopted Hippocratic methods and developed new medical technologies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Leff|Leff|1956|p=102}}</ref> After the [[European Renaissance]], Hippocratic methods were revived in Europe and even further expanded in the 19th century. Notable among those who employed Hippocrates' rigorous clinical techniques were [[Thomas Sydenham|Sydenham]], [[William Heberden|Heberden]], [[Jean-Martin Charcot|Charcot]] and [[William Osler|Osler]]. [[Henri Huchard]], a French physician, said that these revivals make up "the whole history of internal medicine."<ref name="garrison934"/>

===Image===
[[Image:Hippocrates.jpg|thumb|A conventionalized image in a Roman "portrait" bust (19th-century engraving)]]

According to [[Aristotle]]'s testimony, Hippocrates was known as "The Great Hippocrates".<ref name="jones38">{{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=38}}</ref> Concerning his disposition, Hippocrates was first portrayed as a "kind, dignified, old country doctor'" and later as "stern and forbidding".<ref name="marti86"/> He is certainly considered wise, of very great intellect and especially as very practical. [[Francis Adams (translator)|Francis Adams]] describes him as "strictly the physician of experience and common sense."<ref name="adams15"/>

His image as the wise, old doctor is reinforced by busts of him, which wear large beards on a wrinkled face. Many physicians of the time wore their hair in the style of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jove]] and [[Asklepius]]. Accordingly, the busts of Hippocrates that we have could be only altered versions of portraits of these deities.<ref name="garrison100"/> Hippocrates and the beliefs that he embodied are considered medical ideals. [[Fielding Garrison]], an authority on medical history, stated, "He is, above all, the exemplar of that flexible, critical, well-poised attitude of mind, ever on the lookout for sources of error, which is the very essence of the scientific spirit."<ref name="garrison934">{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=94}}</ref> "His figure... stands for all time as that of the ideal physician," according to ''A Short History of Medicine'', inspiring the medical profession since his death.<ref name="sing29">{{Harvnb|Singer|Underwood|1962|p=29}}</ref>

===Legends===
{{Quote_box |width=30% |align=right |quote="Life is short, [the] art long, opportunity fleeting, experiment treacherous, judgment difficult." |source=''Aphorisms'' i.1.}}

Most stories of Hippocrates' life are inconsistent with historical evidence and similar to stories told of other figures (such as [[Avicenna]] and [[Socrates]]), suggesting a legendary origin. Even during his life, Hippocrates' renown was great, and stories of miraculous cures arose. For example, Hippocrates was supposed to have aided in the healing of Athenians during the [[Plague of Athens]] by lighting great fires as "disinfectants" and engaging in other treatments. There is a story of Hippocrates curing [[Perdiccas II of Macedon|Perdiccas]], a [[Macedon]]ian king, of "[[love sickness]]". Neither of these accounts is corroborated by any historians and it seems unlikely that they ever occurred.<ref name="adams1011">{{Harvnb|Adams|1891|pp=10–11}}</ref><ref name="jones37">{{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=37}}</ref><ref name="dictionary">{{Harvnb|Smith|1870|p=483}}</ref>

[[Image:Plane tree of Hippocrates.jpg|thumb|[[Kos]] town: The [[Tree of Hippocrates|Plane Tree of Hippocrates]], under which Hippocrates is said to have worked.<ref name="NHLtree">{{Harvnb|National Library of Medicine|2000}}</ref>]]

Another legend is that Hippocrates rejected a formal request to visit the court of [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes]], the [[King of Persia]].<ref name="pinault">{{Harvnb|Pinault|1992|p=1}}</ref> Though ancient sources accept this as fact, some modern scholars doubt it.<ref name="adams1213">{{Harvnb|Adams|1891|pp=12–13}}</ref> Another tale states that [[Democritus]], supposed to be mad because he laughed at everything, was sent to Hippocrates to be cured. Hippocrates diagnosed him as merely having a happy disposition. Democritus has since been called "the laughing philosopher".<ref>{{Harvnb|Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|2006}}</ref>

Not all stories of Hippocrates portrayed him in a positive manner. In one legend, Hippocrates is said to have fled after setting fire to a [[healing temple]] in Greece. [[Soranus of Ephesus]], the source of this story, names the temple as the one of [[Knidos]]. However, centuries later, the [[Byzantine]] Greek grammarian [[John Tzetzes]] wrote that Hippocrates burned down his own temple, the [[Temple of Cos]], and speculated that he did it to maintain a [[monopoly]] of medical knowledge. This claim directly conflicts with the traditional account of Hippocrates' personality. Other legends tell of his [[resurrection]] of [[Augustus]]'s nephew; this feat was supposedly created by the erection of a statue of Hippocrates and the establishment of a professorship in his honor in Rome.<!--please try to break up/elucidate the preceding sentence--><ref name="margotta66"/><ref name="adams1011"/><ref name="dictionary"/><ref name="jones24">{{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=24}}</ref><!--Even the honey from a beehive on his grave was believed to have healing powers.<ref name="marti86" /><ref name="margotta73" />-->

==Namesakes==
Some clinical symptoms and signs have been named after Hippocrates as he is believed to be the first person to describe those. [[Hippocratic face]] is the change produced in the countenance by death, or long sickness, excessive evacuations, excessive hunger, and the like. [[Nail clubbing|Clubbing]], a deformity of the fingers and fingernails, is also known as Hippocratic fingers. [[Hippocratic succussion]] is the internal splashing noise of [[hydropneumothorax]] or [[pyopneumothorax]]. [[Hippocratic bench]] (a device which uses tension to aid in setting bones) and [[Hippocratic cap-shaped bandage]] are two devices named after Hippocrates.<ref name="Fishchenko">{{Harvnb|Fishchenko|Khimich|1986}}</ref> [[Hippocratic Corpus]] and [[Hippocratic Oath]] are also his namesakes. The drink [[hypocras]] is also believed to be invented by Hippocrates. [[Risus sardonicus]], a sustained spasming of the face muscles may also be termed the Hippocratic Smile.

In the modern age, a lunar crater has been named [[Hippocrates (lunar crater)|Hippocrates]]. The [[Hippocratic Museum]], a [[museum]] on the Greek island of Kos is dedicated to him.
